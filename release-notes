CyberGIS Toolkit is a suite of loosely coupled open-source geospatial software components that provide computationally scalable spatial analysis and modeling capabilities enabled by advanced cyberinfrastructure.

==Software Components==
- PABM: an illustrative software for scalable spatially explicit agent-based modeling (ABM).
- PGAP: a scalable parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) solver for the generalized assignment problem (GAP).
- pRasterBlaster: a high-performance map reprojection software, jointly developed by CEGIS@USGS (http://cegis.usgs.gov) and CIGI (http://cigi.illinois.edu).
- SPTW: a parallel IO code for writing GeoTIFF file on a parallel file system.
- pPySAL: The Parallel PySAL library (https://github.com/pysal/pPysal) provides a set of scalable PySAL functions. 
- TauDEM: A high-performance software, developed by the Hydrology Research Group at the Utah State University (http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/index.html), for watershed delineation and the extraction of hydrological information from topography.
- gKDE: A multi-GPU code for data-intensive kernel density estimation (KDE). Spatial computational domain is first estimated for KDE. Then the study area is decompose into sub-regions through an adaptive partitioning approach. Each sub-region is processed by a GPU node. These GPU nodes are communicated through massage passing interface (MPI).
- MapAlgebra: this package contains a parallel map algebra code using CUDA, MPI, and Parallel I/O. It is extracted from a parallel geospatial programming models training package.

====Software Environment====
CyberGIS Toolkit has been tested to run in the following software environment:
- Compilers: GNU, Intel
- MPI: OpenMPI 1.4.3, mvapich2 1.5.1, Cray MPI
- OS: CentOS 5.5 64bit

Please refer to each component's README/INSTALL document on how to compile and install them.
